# Hello People,
### Welcome, to MonMovies.
I made a movie watchlist website using the most amazing technology `ReactJS` .
Here you can search any movie and save it in your watchlater or watched. The movies get saved in your browser localstorage so it is local to the devise and after closing the website you can again visit the website from the same device to view your saved movies.

### Other tool used
 `reduxjs` - for state management\
 `materialui` - for styling website\
 `API used` - [The Movie DB](https://lnkd.in/gjDpqZU)\
 `github` - to host the website
